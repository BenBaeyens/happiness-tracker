## Short Description
The Happiness Tracker App is an app that allows you to track how happy you are, why and when.
It is designed to help people find out what brings value to their life, and cut out what brings sorrow.
> An easy-to-use, fun app that helps you stay happy!

## Why I made the app
I am really interested in living a happy life, and for a while I had been searching for a way to improve my happiness without changing my lifestyle around completely. This was the solution. It allows me to isolate things I like and don't like, and organise my day according to those things. I really think this app could be beneficial to other people as much as it is to me.

## What I learned from this project
With every project I do, I hope to learn something from it. This was especially true for this project as this app is the first app I ever made.
I learned a lot of things ranging from coding to graphical design, such as:
- Coming up with intricate UI elements that appeal to the user
- How to develop and build an app for Android
- Unity's UI system & all it's components
- Creating interactable UI elements in C#
- Organise my time efficiently to make time for development

I also learned some other skills, like:
- How to write cleaner and more efficient code
- How to efficiently read documentation
- Overcome problems that seem unsolvable at first glance
- Find like-minded people online

Overall, this project was very helpful towards developing my skillset and expanding my portfolio for future use.

## What I would change
> If I were to start the project all over again, what would I do differently, what would I change?

- Something I would definitely do differently is to do proper research first. This is something I struggled with for a while and slowed down development drastically as I had to accomodate for the larger screenspace of some phones, which I wouldn't have to do if I had researched this beforehand.

- Even though doing this project taught me a lot about maintaining a clean code structure, it is definitely something I would like to improve on, and I will most definitely do this in my next project.
